# Visualizator

This is a redesign of a web application developed by me for a class project while I was in the university.

The main purpose of this application is to present the information about the classes that a student took.

## Objective

After entering a GRR number (a student's identification), a table containing the subjects' codes is presented. The content is colored in the following way:

- red: subject that the student took and did not pass.
- green: subject that the student took and passed in one of the attemps.
- blue: subject that the student is taking right now.
- purple: subject that the student canceled.
- yellow: subject that has a equivalent, which the student took and passed.
- gray: subject that the student never took.

Once you move the cursor over the subjects' codes, a detailed information is presented in the form.

## How to use it:

The input need to be given in the following range: GRR00000000 to GRR00000011.

Move the cursor over the subjects' codes to have access to a detailed information.

## To do:

I still want to add the option of displaying the information about all the attempts a student took for each subject.
